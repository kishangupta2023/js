## 4 pillars 
* Abstraction -> fetch it just hide all the details from u so that we arenot worried about how network call occurs ; 
* Encapsulation ->rap up the data so that we can access what we want and also it hides the data which we do not want to access  
* Inheritance -> in prototypes video 
* Polymorphism -> poly(many) + morphism (diffrent shape) use chatgpt
